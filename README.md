# AMLT Practical Project 2016-17

This repository contains the analysis of two topics in Machine Learning; Distance Based Outlier Detection, and Clustering.

## Distance Based Outlier Detection

Among Distance Based Outlier Detection Algorithms, two of them; k-th neares neighbor as known as dee-kay-en, and one-time sampling 
have been implemented in the following files:

* kth_NN.py
* sampling.py

## Clustering Algorithm

K-Means and Bisecting K-Means have been implemented in the following two files:

* kmeans_numpy.py
* bikmeans_numpy.py

## Ipython Notebooks:

An Ipython notebook named "Experiment One - Outlier Detection" has been provided that uses, analyzes and reports the outlier 
detection algorithm.

Another Ipython notebook named "Experiment Two - Clustering Algorithms" has been provided that uses, analyzes and reports the
clustering algorithms.

## PDF Files:
Some PDF files that were studied have been attached along with a final report about the research.
